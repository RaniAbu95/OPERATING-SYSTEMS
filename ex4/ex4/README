Remarks: 

    CacheFS.cpp design: 
	in this file we implemented cache file system. to help us implement this we used many
    data structures and structs. first we have vector called blocksUsedVector this one help
    us know which block was running first and which one after it and so. this helps us
    implementing the LRU algorithm. we also have map of string  as a key and vector of
    int as a value, this map contains for each file path the list of his id's.
    we also have map of the fdBlocks. for each file which blocks id's it contains.
    also we created two structs, one is Block that contains many fields of the block
    and the other one is caching_state that contains the cache data structure and some
    more fields. running the submitted makefile should make cacheFS library that user
    can use it's functions to read and open file without reaching the desk every time.
